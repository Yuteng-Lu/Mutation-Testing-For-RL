Here is a table showing all mutation operators in detail. The design and improvement of mutation operators is the core of our work. Sufficient and complete mutation operators can help us cover more corner cases. We hope to eventually collect common mistakes in academia and industry to further refine mutation operators for reinforcement learning systems.

Important stages in the reinforcement learning process include the preparation stage before learning, the training stage during learning, and the deployment stage after learning. The operators shown in the table are mainly for potential issues in the training stage, and partially cover the possible problems in the deployment stage. If you encounter other errors in the above three stages, please contact luyuteng@pku.edu.cn. Your help will bring us a more credible world of reinforcement learning!
